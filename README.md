# Arduino-RFID
Simple RFID code for Arduino

This code is setup to work with an LCD screen wired up like this tutorial from AdaFruit:

You don't need the LCD sceen wired up, it works just fine without, but the LCD screen is nice for testing and getting RFID card numbers by scanning them and having them show up on the LCD screen.

The reader, reader board, and relay board are from SparkFun.
